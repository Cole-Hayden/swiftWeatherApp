# swiftWeatherApp

This application uses the open weather api, and is a great example of retrieving json using alamofire, parsing the data, 
and updating the UI based off of textfield input.

#HOW TO USE
Click the white arrows located in upper right corner to choose your city, 
then when you have typed in the city click the button directly below the text field to view the temperature.
